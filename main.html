		<p class="movieDetail">As a part of the audience, I feel that I just have to write this review, as unfortunate as it may be. I watched Pathaan with my family and there were multiple scenes that were just inappropriate and unnecessary. Other than that, the plot was super unclear and I didn't understand why a virus was brought into it. I thought we would be seeing something new, as there are many films from the past that have this same trope of a deadly virus. The movie was 2 hrs and 30 minutes approximately, quite a long film but I don't understand why everything in the film, every sequence, felt rushed and like it didn't make much sense. I also found the CGI and VFX extremely fake and artificial, which was disappointing. I know that a team and actors worked really hard to make this film as they do others, but I feel that Pathaan just took advantage of the fact that there were stars like SRK, Deepika, John Abraham, and Salman Khan in it. Would you genuinely enjoy the film had it been some other actors? Anyway, I do feel like I had my hopes up too high for this film. I just hope that Bollywood can make good films again soon.</p>
